Purpose of the Design 

How often do we find ourselves waking up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom or grab a glass of water? It’s inconvenient to turn on a bright ceiling light, and fumbling around with your phone for some light isn’t much better. What if there were a way to solve this problem both stylishly and effectively?

The issue as follows. Falls are attributed to being the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide. With increased illumination being one of the leading recommendations for changes to be made within houses, especially when it is dark outside.

The solution to illuminating the house without negatively impacting sleep and the circadian rhythm are nightlights. Today's nightlights traditionally come in two variants: a  a single dim light that stays on the whole night, or a single dim light that turns on for a given amount of time upon detecting motion. 

We felt that these solutions were inadequate given that the light would often times be so far away, and that it was easy for a single light to be blocked by obstacles such as furniture. So we looked into how we could solve these issue with an LED strip for lighting instead.
